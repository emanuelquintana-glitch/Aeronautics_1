# Objectives and Rationale {#sec-objectives-rationale}

## Overview

This manuscript represents an extension and comprehensive revision of lecture notes originally developed for a graduate-level course on Aerospace Modeling and Control at Politecnico di Torino. The primary objective is to apply **model-based control design** to orbit and attitude control systems, where models are expressed in terms of **state equations**.

::: {.callout-note}
## Target Audience

This text is designed for multiple categories of readers:

- **PhD students** specializing in aerospace engineering and control systems
- **Researchers** in aerospace sciences and control theory
- **Practicing engineers** in the space industry
- **Advanced graduate students** with strong backgrounds in dynamics and control
:::

## Fundamental and Advanced Topics

The book addresses both fundamental and advanced topics, with particular emphasis on:

1. **State equation formulation**
2. **Feedback design methodologies**
3. **Uncertainty-based state predictor design**
4. **Model-based control law development**

These foundational elements prepare readers for specialized control topics including state predictors and advanced control strategies.

## Why the Embedded Model Control Methodology? {#sec-why-emc}

The selected design methodology is **Embedded Model Control (EMC)**, chosen based on extensive experience and proven effectiveness in spacecraft applications.

### The Term "Embedded"

::: {#def-embedded-model}
## Embedded Model

The term **"embedded"** (not related to embedded computing systems) signifies that any control unit is built around a **discrete-time (DT) state equation** of the plant to be controlled, called the **embedded model**.
:::

The embedded model operates as a **real-time digital twin** of the spacecraft, running in parallel and synchronously with the actual plant.

### Core Principles of EMC

The EMC methodology is founded on three fundamental principles:

#### Principle 1: Synchronized Real-Time Model {#sec-principle1}

State equations enable implementation of control units that execute a real-time plant model (the embedded model) **in parallel and synchronously** with the plant itself.

**Key Feature**: The **same digital command** sent to the plant (spacecraft) is simultaneously sent to the embedded model.

::: {.callout-important}
## Command Saturation Prevention

This principle has proven effective in preventing performance degradation under **command saturation** conditions—a critical consideration in spacecraft control where actuator limitations are always present.
:::

**Mathematical Formulation**:

The embedded model in discrete time is expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{x}_m(k+1) &= \mathbf{A}_m \mathbf{x}_m(k) + \mathbf{B}_m \mathbf{u}(k) + \mathbf{B}_w \mathbf{w}(k) \\
\mathbf{y}_m(k) &= \mathbf{C}_m \mathbf{x}_m(k)
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-embedded-model}

where:

- $\mathbf{x}_m(k)$: State vector of the embedded model
- $\mathbf{u}(k)$: Control command (sent to both plant and model)
- $\mathbf{w}(k)$: Disturbance input
- $\mathbf{y}_m(k)$: Model output

#### Principle 2: Disturbance Dynamics and Noise Estimation {#sec-principle2}

The embedded model must always be completed with **disturbance dynamics**.

::: {#def-disturbance-dynamics}
## Disturbance Dynamics

A set of equations capable of storing in their state variables all **past discrepancies** between the plant and the model (collectively called **uncertainty**) that need to be canceled.
:::

**Disturbance State Equation**:

$$
\mathbf{x}_d(k+1) = \mathbf{A}_d \mathbf{x}_d(k) + \mathbf{w}(k)
$$ {#eq-disturbance-dynamics}

The synthesis of disturbance dynamics uses the "design model" to define expected uncertainty classes:

1. **Initial state uncertainty**
2. **Causal uncertainty** (unknown inputs)
3. **Parametric uncertainty** (model parameter errors)
4. **Neglected dynamics** (unmodeled high-frequency modes)

**Noise Design and Estimation**:

The disturbance state must be continuously updated through **noise design and estimation**:

- Input signals $\mathbf{w}(k)$ are formulated as **white noise processes** in a stochastic framework
- Recovery of input noise is achieved through **correlation with measured model error**:

$$
e_m(k) = \bar{\mathbf{y}}(k) - \mathbf{y}_m(k)
$$ {#eq-model-error}

where $\bar{\mathbf{y}}(k)$ represents plant measurements.

**Noise Estimator** (output-to-noise feedback):

$$
\hat{\mathbf{w}}(k) = \mathbf{L}_w e_m(k)
$$ {#eq-noise-estimator}

The gain matrix $\mathbf{L}_w$ is designed to **stabilize the closed-loop error system**.

::: {.callout-tip}
## State Predictor

The combination of embedded model and noise estimator functions as a **closed-loop state predictor**. The state predictor design is considered **uncertainty-based**.
:::

#### Principle 3: Model-Based Control Law Design {#sec-principle3}

The control law design is **model-based**, using the embedded model state variables and reference variables as ingredients.

**Sequential Design Requirement**:

The design is conditioned by state predictor dynamics and must be developed **without degrading state predictor performance**. This requires:

1. **State predictor design** precedes control law design
2. **Tracking errors** (embedded model minus reference variables) are **numerically zero**

**Control Law Structure**:

$$
\mathbf{u}(k) = \mathbf{u}_{ff}(k) + \mathbf{u}_{fb}(k)
$$ {#eq-control-law}

where:

- $\mathbf{u}_{ff}(k)$: Feedforward component (from reference trajectory)
- $\mathbf{u}_{fb}(k) = -\mathbf{K} \tilde{\mathbf{x}}(k)$: Feedback component
- $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}(k) = \mathbf{x}_m(k) - \mathbf{x}_{ref}(k)$: Tracking error

### Design Procedure

The EMC design procedure employs **closed-loop pole placement**, leveraging:

- **Asymptotic sensitivity** ($\tilde{S}$)
- **Complementary sensitivity** ($\tilde{V}$)

of both the state predictor and overall control loop.

### Validation and Flight Heritage

::: {.callout-note}
## GOCE Mission Application

The EMC models and algorithms described have been:

- Tested in ground-based instruments and prototypes
- Applied to the **GOCE satellite** (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer) Drag-Free and Attitude Control (DFAC) system design
:::

## Analogical Understanding of EMC

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
## Pilot Analogy

EMC methodology works analogously to a pilot using a **digital twin** of their aircraft running in real-time. When the pilot issues a control command, that same command is injected into the digital twin. 

If the real aircraft's instruments (measurements) differ from what the digital twin predicts, that difference (measured model error) is not merely viewed as a simple error, but as a **revealing signal** of unknown disturbances (wind, engine noise, sensor errors).

The system uses this signal to:

1. **Estimate** those unknown disturbances (disturbance dynamics)
2. **Predict** them one step ahead
3. Allow the control law to immediately calculate a **corrective command** to cancel them

This ensures robust performance before the disturbance significantly affects the trajectory.
