# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Motivation and Context

The design and operation of spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems represent one of the most challenging aspects of space mission engineering. Modern spacecraft must achieve increasingly stringent pointing accuracy requirements—often at the arc-second level—while operating in harsh environments characterized by extreme temperatures, radiation, microgravity, and complex disturbance torques.

This manuscript emerged from the need for a comprehensive, mathematically rigorous treatment of spacecraft dynamics and control that bridges theoretical foundations with practical implementation. The work is heavily influenced by the Embedded Model Control (EMC) methodology developed by Canuto et al. [@canuto2018spacecraft], which provides a systematic framework for handling model uncertainties and disturbance rejection.

**Part IV: Estimation and Control** presents methods for attitude determination from sensor measurements and develops control laws for both attitude and orbital control. The EMC approach is introduced and applied.

**Part V: Applications** demonstrates the concepts through detailed case studies, including a complete ADCS design for a scientific mission.

# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

## Overview of Spacecraft Control Systems

Spacecraft Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) systems are responsible for determining the spacecraft's position and orientation (navigation), computing desired trajectories and attitudes (guidance), and generating commands to actuators to follow these trajectories (control).

The GNC system typically consists of three main subsystems:

1. **Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)**: Manages spacecraft orientation
2. **Orbital Control System**: Maintains desired orbital parameters
3. **Navigation System**: Determines position and velocity

### Functional Architecture

The typical architecture of a spacecraft GNC system is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:gnc-architecture).

2. **Physical Insight**: Clear explanations of underlying physics
3. **Practical Methods**: Implementable algorithms and numerical techniques
4. **Realistic Models**: High-fidelity sensor and actuator models
5. **Design Guidelines**: Systematic approaches to control system design

- Analyze stability and performance of closed-loop systems

## Mathematical Framework

### State-Space Representation

Spacecraft dynamics are naturally expressed in state-space form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\vec{x}} &= \vec{f}(\vec{x}, \vec{u}, t) + \vec{w}(t) \\
\vec{y} &= \vec{h}(\vec{x}, t) + \vec{v}(t)
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-state-space}

where:

- $\vec{x} \in \mathbf{RR}^n$: State vector
- $\vec{u} \in \mathbf{RR}^m$: Control input
- $\vec{y} \in \mathbf{RR}^p$: Measurement vector
- $\vec{w}(t)$: Process noise
- $\vec{v}(t)$: Measurement noise

### Attitude Representation

The attitude (orientation) of a rigid body can be represented by a rotation matrix $\mathbf{R} \in \mathrm{SO(3)}$, where:

$$ 
\mathrm{SO(3)} = \{\mathbf{R} \in \mathbb{R}^{3\times 3} : \mathbf{R}^T\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{I}, \det(\mathbf{R}) = +1\} 
$$
{#eq-so3}

The Special Orthogonal Group $\mathrm{SO(3)}$ is a three-dimensional manifold, requiring three independent parameters for complete specification.

**Unit Quaternions** provide a singularity-free four-parameter representation:

$$
\mathbf{q} = \begin{bmatrix} q_0 \\ \vec{q}_v \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{S}^3, \quad \|\mathbf{q}\| = 1
$$ {#eq-quaternion}

The relationship between rotation angle $\phi$ about axis $\vec{e}$ and quaternion is:

$$
\mathbf{q} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\phi/2) \\ \vec{e} \sin(\phi/2) \end{bmatrix}

$$ {#eq-axis-angle-quat}

## The Embedded Model Control Paradigm

The Embedded Model Control (EMC) approach, central to this manuscript, is based on the following principles:

### 1. Disturbance Modeling

Rather than treating disturbances as unknown inputs, EMC explicitly models their dynamics:

$$
\dot{\vec{x}}_d = \mathbf{A}_d\vec{x}_d + \vec{w}_d(t)
$$ {#eq-disturbance-model}

where $\vec{x}_d$ represents the disturbance state.

### 2. State Prediction

A state predictor estimates both plant and disturbance states:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\hat{\vec{x}}} &= \mathbf{A}\hat{\vec{x}} + \mathbf{B}\vec{u} + \mathbf{L}(\vec{y} - \hat{\vec{y}}) \\
\dot{\hat{\vec{x}}}_d &= \mathbf{A}_d\hat{\vec{x}}_d + \mathbf{L}_d(\vec{y} - \hat{\vec{y}})
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-state-predictor}

### 3. Control Law

The control law combines reference tracking and disturbance rejection:

$$
\vec{u} = \vec{u}_{cmd}(\vec{r}) + \vec{u}_{dist}(\hat{\vec{x}}_d)
$$ {#eq-emc-control}

This architecture provides:

- **Systematic disturbance rejection**
- **Explicit handling of model uncertainty**
- **Separation of tracking and regulation**
- **High bandwidth with robustness**

## Organization of Remaining Chapters

The remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows:

**Chapter 2** develops the mathematical theory of attitude representation, including rotation matrices, Euler angles, quaternions, and Modified Rodrigues Parameters.

**Chapter 3** presents orbital dynamics, from the two-body problem through orbit propagation methods and trajectory analysis.

**Chapter 4** analyzes environmental perturbations affecting spacecraft, including gravitational harmonics, atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, and magnetic fields.

**Chapter 5** treats perturbed orbital dynamics, deriving the Gauss and Lagrange variational equations and analyzing relative motion.

**Chapter 6** develops attitude kinematics, relating angular velocity to time derivatives of attitude parameters.

**Chapter 7** presents attitude dynamics, deriving Euler's equations and analyzing torque-free motion and environmental torques.

**Chapters 8-9** provide detailed models of sensors and actuators used in spacecraft GNC systems.

**Chapters 10-12** develop estimation and control methods, including attitude determination algorithms and control law design.

**Chapters 13-14** present applications through case studies and introduce advanced topics.
